Before playing with Monast you must install a couple of things in
your system (with administrator privileges). Make sure to have both
PHP5 and Python2.6+ installed.

Copy the sample file named monast.conf.sample from the pymon/
directory to /etc/monast.conf and edit it properly as documented
inside of this file. Do some tests with your Asterisk Manager
Interface user before trying it out, maybe it's your fault and not
Monast's. You can then execute the monast.py script located in the
pymon/ directory as well. You should see a bunch of log messages
confirming the AMI login and start receiving events.

Monast has been successfully tested under many Linux distributions
(like Slackware, CentOS and Mandriva) and also on MacOS X.
